## Critical Issues Requiring Expert Review

### 1. eBay Webhook Verification Failure
**Status**: BLOCKING - Required for eBay API compliance

**Problem**: eBay's webhook verification continues to fail despite our endpoint working correctly in local testing.

**Evidence of Working Implementation**:
- Local GET test: Returns `{"status":"eBay webhook endpoint is active","timestamp":"..."}`
- Local POST verification test: Correctly validates token and returns `{"challengeResponse":"test123"}`
- All logging shows proper request handling and token validation

**Implementation Details** (`server/routes.ts` lines 235-273):
```typescript
app.post("/api/ebay/webhook", async (req, res) => {
  const { challengeCode, verificationToken } = req.body;
  
  if (challengeCode && verificationToken) {
    const expectedToken = 'scryvaul_webhook_verification_2025';
    if (verificationToken === expectedToken) {
      return res.status(200).json({ challengeResponse: challengeCode });
    }
  }
  // ... additional notification handling
});
```

**Possible Root Causes**:
- eBay's verification system expects different JSON structure
- Production eBay API requires specific HTTP headers
- Replit domain accessibility issues during verification
- Missing authentication beyond webhook token

### 2. eBay Finding API Authentication Issues
**Status**: DEGRADED - Showing placeholder data instead of real market insights

**Problem**: Despite having Production App ID (`ldernTom-ScryVaul-PRD-0f0240608-25d29f7a`), the eBay Finding API isn't returning authentic pricing data.

**Current Behavior**: 
- API calls are being made (confirmed by logging)
- Returning placeholder values: "$8-15 & Medium confidence"
- Should show real sold listing data for market analysis

**Implementation** (`server/pricing-service.ts`):
- Using eBay Finding Service v1 with completed items filter
- Searching category 267 (Books) with 30-day sold listings
- Proper URL construction and request formatting

**Possible Issues**:
- Production Finding API requires OAuth beyond App ID
- Additional developer approval needed for completed listings access
- API permissions not properly configured in eBay Developer portal

## API Configuration Status
✅ **eBay App ID**: `ldernTom-ScryVaul-PRD-0f0240608-25d29f7a` (Production)  
✅ **ISBNdb API Key**: Active and returning real book metadata  
✅ **Database**: PostgreSQL with proper schema  
✅ **Core Features**: Inventory management, barcode scanning, book lookup all functional  

## Application Architecture
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, mobile-first PWA
- **Backend**: Express.js with proper error handling
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **APIs**: ISBNdb (working), eBay Finding Service (authentication issues)

## Testing Results
**Local Development**: All endpoints respond correctly  
**Production Deployment**: Core app functional, webhook verification failing  
**Database**: All CRUD operations working properly  
**Book Lookup**: ISBNdb integration returning authentic metadata  

## Business Impact
- **Webhook verification required** for eBay marketplace compliance
- **Real pricing data needed** for competitive market analysis
- **Professional deployment ready** except for these two authentication issues

## Files Requiring Review
1. `server/routes.ts` - Webhook endpoint implementation
2. `server/pricing-service.ts` - eBay Finding API integration  
3. `WEBHOOK_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` - Detailed technical analysis

## Request
Please review the webhook implementation and eBay API authentication to identify what production requirements we're missing. The local testing proves our logic is correct - this appears to be a production authentication or formatting issue specific to eBay's systems.

Both issues seem related to eBay's production authentication requirements that may differ from their documentation or sandbox behavior.
