ScryVault Master Development Plan V5.1
Unified Reseller Intelligence Platform
CTO: Corbin | CEO: Michael Caldwell | Updated: June 7 2025

MISSION STATEMENT
ScryVault is no longer just a book inventory tool‚Äîit is becoming the all-in-one intelligence platform for professional resellers. We aim to provide a seamless, mobile-first system that enables scanning, sourcing, inventory control, COGS tracking, financial reporting, and eventually predictive buying‚Äîwithout ever opening a spreadsheet.
The platform is being built for high-output, detail-obsessed sellers who rely on speed, automation, and clarity to maintain profitability in a volatile marketplace. Our long-term objective is to become the default back-office suite for collectible-focused sellers.

SKU doubles as the primary key for inventory copy instances
SKU logic uses local count of matching SKUs to determine next available

CONCLUSION
ScryVault V5.1 is designed not only to scale, but to delight. Its core strength is trust‚Äîevery feature should feel like it was handcrafted by someone who understands the reseller workflow. We don‚Äôt build CRUD apps. We build money engines.
Let‚Äôs move forward and make this the default platform for collectible book resellers.
üìú V5.1 is now the canonical roadmap, superseding all prior structure and SKU logic.
Ready to execute, Sir.
