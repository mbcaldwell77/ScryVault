**DIRECTIVE FOR REPLIT AGENT - PHASE 2.1 IMPLEMENTATION**

**CRITICAL PRIORITY 1: Database Environment Separation**

Before ANY further development work, we need to establish proper data isolation. Michael will be using this app for his actual Ældern Tomes inventory, so we cannot risk development work interfering with production data.

**Required Actions:**
1. **Verify current database configuration** - Check if we're using separate dev/prod databases or if they're shared
2. **Implement database seeding system** - Create a comprehensive dummy dataset for development that includes:
   - Sample books across different conditions and formats
   - Realistic pricing data 
   - Various purchase locations and dates
   - Multiple copies of same ISBN to test grouping
3. **Environment variable validation** - Ensure `NODE_ENV=development` uses test database, `NODE_ENV=production` uses live data
4. **Data migration safety** - Implement backup/restore procedures before any schema changes

**CRITICAL PRIORITY 2: eBay Webhook Compliance Resolution**

The eBay marketplace deletion endpoint is still failing verification. This blocks our API access.

**Required Actions:**
1. **Debug webhook response format** - eBay may expect specific headers or response structure
2. **Test endpoint accessibility** - Verify eBay can reach our deployed URL during verification
3. **Update verification token if needed** - Current token may not match eBay's expectations
4. **Document the exact verification flow** for future reference

**DEVELOPMENT PRIORITY 3: Core Feature Polish**

With database safety established and eBay compliance fixed:
1. **Enhance pricing intelligence** - Integrate live eBay pricing data with confidence scoring
2. **Improve form workflows** - Standardize add/edit experiences 
3. **Advanced inventory features** - Bulk operations, enhanced search/filtering

**Success Criteria:**
- Michael can safely use the app for real inventory without data loss risk
- eBay webhook verification passes
- Live pricing data flows correctly
- All core features work reliably in production

**Report back immediately on database environment status before proceeding with any other work.**

This is not optional - data integrity comes first.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
