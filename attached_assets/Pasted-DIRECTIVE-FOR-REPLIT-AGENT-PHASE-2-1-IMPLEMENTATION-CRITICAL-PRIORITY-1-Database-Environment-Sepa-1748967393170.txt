DIRECTIVE FOR REPLIT AGENT - PHASE 2.1 IMPLEMENTATION
CRITICAL PRIORITY 1: Database Environment Separation
Before ANY further development work, we need to establish proper data isolation. Michael will be using this app for his actual Ã†ldern Tomes inventory, so we cannot risk development work interfering with production data.
Required Actions:

Verify current database configuration - Check if we're using separate dev/prod databases or if they're shared
Implement database seeding system - Create a comprehensive dummy dataset for development that includes:

Sample books across different conditions and formats
Realistic pricing data
Various purchase locations and dates
Multiple copies of same ISBN to test grouping


Environment variable validation - Ensure NODE_ENV=development uses test database, NODE_ENV=production uses live data
Data migration safety - Implement backup/restore procedures before any schema changes

CRITICAL PRIORITY 2: eBay Webhook Compliance Resolution
The eBay marketplace deletion endpoint is still failing verification. This blocks our API access.
Required Actions:

Debug webhook response format - eBay may expect specific headers or response structure
Test endpoint accessibility - Verify eBay can reach our deployed URL during verification
Update verification token if needed - Current token may not match eBay's expectations
Document the exact verification flow for future reference

DEVELOPMENT PRIORITY 3: Core Feature Polish
With database safety established and eBay compliance fixed:

Enhance pricing intelligence - Integrate live eBay pricing data with confidence scoring
Improve form workflows - Standardize add/edit experiences
Advanced inventory features - Bulk operations, enhanced search/filtering

Success Criteria:

Michael can safely use the app for real inventory without data loss risk
eBay webhook verification passes
Live pricing data flows correctly
All core features work reliably in production

Report back immediately on database environment status before proceeding with any other work.
This is not optional - data integrity comes first.
