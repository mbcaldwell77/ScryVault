REPLIT AGENT DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTION
You are tasked with fixing a critical authentication bug in the ScryVault application that is preventing users from updating their account profiles.
CONTEXT:

ScryVault is a React/TypeScript book inventory management application
We are in Phase 1A of development (User Authentication & Security)
Authentication system is implemented but has a bug in the account management page
User can log in successfully but cannot update profile due to missing auth headers

SPECIFIC TASK:
Fix the authentication headers in the account page profile update functionality.
EXACT STEPS TO EXECUTE:

Navigate to client/src/pages/account.tsx
Locate the profileMutation object (approximately line 60-80)
Replace the existing mutationFn with this exact code:

typescriptmutationFn: async (data: { firstName: string; lastName: string; email: string }) => {
  return await apiRequest("/api/auth/update-profile", {
    method: "PUT",
    body: JSON.stringify(data)
  });
},

Locate the passwordMutation object (approximately line 90-110)
Replace the existing mutationFn with this exact code:

typescriptmutationFn: async (data: { currentPassword: string; newPassword: string }) => {
  return await apiRequest("/api/auth/change-password", {
    method: "POST",
    body: JSON.stringify(data)
  });
},

Verify that apiRequest is imported at the top of the file:

typescriptimport { apiRequest } from "@/lib/queryClient";
CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

Do NOT modify any other code in the file
Do NOT add additional features or "improvements"
Do NOT change the UI components or styling
ONLY fix the authentication header issue by using apiRequest instead of manual fetch calls

EXPECTED OUTCOME:
After this fix, users should be able to update their profile information and change passwords without receiving "Not authenticated" errors.
VERIFICATION:
The account page should show successful profile updates and password changes when the form is submitted.
Execute this fix immediately. This is blocking user account management functionality.
